# Question 1: Are Gal√°pagos mericarps generally under selection? ####

# There are two approaches to this question. The first one is model testing.
# The second one, is to build the main figure for this question. The figure is
# a 1:1 comparison of eaten and uneaten mericarps grouped by island or population.
# Year is not considered for this question.

# We used a GLMM with mericarp traits 
# (size traits: length, depth, width and depth; 
# and spine traits: longest spine, spine tip distance, lower spines) 
# as predictor of survival (eaten/uneaten mericarps). 
# We used Year, Island, and Population (nested within Island) as random factors ####
