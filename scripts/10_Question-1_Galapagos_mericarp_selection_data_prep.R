# Question 1: Are Gal√°pagos mericarps generally under selection? ####

# Date: 02 January, 2023
# By: Daniel Reyes

# Description ####
# There are two approaches to this question. The first one is model testing.
# Model testing datasets are named after their traits: (Length, depth, etc)
# 
# The second one, is to build the main figure for this question. The figure is
# a 1:1 comparison of eaten and uneaten mericarps grouped by island or population.
# Year is not considered for this question.

# We used a GLMM with mericarp traits 
# (size traits: length, depth, width and depth; 
# and spine traits: longest spine, spine tip distance, lower spines) 
# as predictor of survival (eaten/uneaten mericarps). 
# The datasets are exported to the Processed Data folder.

# We used Year, Island, and Population (nested within Island) as random factors ####

# Load the point in time dataset ####
# This dataset is the point in time dataset for all years

### Group for count estimates ####
### One way to estimate this for lower spines to count the frequency of eaten
### and uneaten mericarps. So, instead of using a mean I am using the number of 
### mericarps that have lower spines and the number witouth lower spines.

#### Group by island ####
lower_spines <- group_by(lower_spines, island, eaten)


# Count the frequency of lower spines
lower_spines_island <- dplyr::count(lower_spines, lower_spine)
# This counts the number of mericarps that were eaten (or not) that have lower spines (or not)

# Frequencies of lower spines
lower_spines_island <- lower_spines_island %>%  
  group_by(island) %>% mutate(freq = n/sum(n))
# I think this way you estimate the frequency of mericarps with either lower spines
# or not lower spines that were eaten or not per island.
# The total sum of mericarps per island and the frequency of mericarps with (or not)]
# lower spines that were eaten (or not).
